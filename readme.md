# Personal Resume Website

This is my personal website to document my skillset, showoff my resume, and show off my web development prowess. It uses Javascript, SCSS styling, PUG html templates, YARN package manager, and GULP to tie it all together. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with npm package manager
* (optional) [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), if you don't want to use npm.


### Installing

First install all the packages with ``npm install`` or ``yarn``

**build a prod-ready build folder** ``npm run build`` or ``yarn build``

**dev build with local server** ``npm start`` or ``yarn start``

**overview of all of the gulp tasks and what they do** ``npm run tasks`` or ``yarn tasks`` 


## Running the tests

No tests yet, will come at a later date. Static sites don't really require much testing.

## Deployment

Will deploy to an FTP server, either the usual way, or via Travis CI for testing, to be determined...

## Built With

* [PUG](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) - HTMl templates
* [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SCSS_FOR_SASS_USERS.html) - Pre-processed css
* [GULP](https://gulpjs.com/) - Task runner and builder
* [NODE.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Runs Gulp, tests and other scripts.


# TODO:

* design out project carousel - desktop and mobile
* fill in projects info (w/ links)

## website design ideas:

* One page with scroll-to
* Name really big at top - if multipage - change into each page title ?
    * super quick cycle through all letters and land on one u need
* super simple spaceous white text on color BG w alternating black text and white bg strips
